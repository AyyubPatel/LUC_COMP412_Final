# LUC_COMP412_Final
My final submission on final project Stephanie

I am using this repo just to show my contribution. The videos.txt file has the youtube links of the my videos. There are two modules which I tried 
to add in this project. One is world clock in which the virtual assistant gives us the current time of any city in the world. Another one is 
for Slack, using which we can post messages on Slack. The modules.json files just shows how did I created modules and which key words I used 
to initiate the execution of that particular module. These are separate files and not the whole project.
